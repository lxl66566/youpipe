//! This module provides two waitgroup implementation, works in blocking & async context.
//! The implementation is low-cost ref-counting (counter and waker state is packed inside one atomic), the max value
//! is (1 << (usize::BITS - 2) - 2)
//!
//! - [WaitGroupInline]: Which embedded inline with its parent structure (with no dereference cost)
//!   - (It requires its parent can be accessed by multi thread, for deep embedded scenario)
//!   - Threshold is const
//!   - Requires manual ref count manage, ([done()](WaitGroupInline::done) [done_many()](WaitGroupInline::done_many) is unsafe).
//!   - only one waiter thread is allowed. ([wait()](WaitGroupInline::wait),
//!     [wait_async()](WaitGroupInline::wait_async) is unsafe)
//!
//! - [WaitGroupZero]: which is a safe RAII guard API.
//!   - Its a referenced counted container, optional state inside may be shared between the threads of WaitGroup and its guards.
//!   - Only one waiter is allowed. (`WaitGroup` is `!Sync`)
//!   - Use [WaitGroupZero::add_guard()] to get [WaitGroupZeroGuard].
//!   - [WaitGroupZeroGuard] has `Clone` (Although `WaitGroup` can not `Clone`)
//!   - [WaitGroupZeroGuard] drop will decrease ref and protentially wake the main thread.
//!   - [WaitGroupZeroGuard] has `from_raw` and `into_raw`.
//!
//! - [WaitGroup]: A superset of [WaitGroupZero], with additional feature:
//!   - It has custom threshold.
//!   - can change threshold at any time.
//!     - **NOTE**: threshold is carried inside generated [WaitGroupGuard] to minimize the cost of atomic ops.
//!       When changing threshold to larger value, wait() might not wake up as soon as new threshold reached.
//!   - [WaitGroupGuard] cannot convert from raw pointer.
//!
//! # Safety
//!
//! [WaitGroup]/[WaitGroupZero] does not have `Sync` marker, because it's not safe to concurrently wait, due to only one slot reserved for waker.
//!
//! Methods to get around compilation limits:
//! - Use [WaitGroupInline] inside parent structure, and use unsafe.
//! - Use `unsafe impl Sync` on parent structure of `WaitGroup`, and access `WaitGroup` via parent.
//! - Use `&mut` reference of `Waitgroup`, because `&mut WaitGroup` have `Send`
//!
//! ```
//! use crossfire::waitgroup::WaitGroup;
//! use std::sync::Arc;
//! pub struct Parent {
//!     wg: WaitGroup<()>,
//! }
//! // allow parent to have Sync marker for Arc
//! unsafe impl Sync for Parent {}
//!
//! let _parent = Arc::new(Parent{
//!     wg: WaitGroup::new((), 0),
//! });
//! ```
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! **Blocking Example: Concurrency Limiter**
//!
//! This example simulates a task scheduler that uses a `WaitGroup` to limit
//! the number of concurrently running tasks to a specific watermark.
//! It also uses the generic `T` to carry a shared state (e.g. `AtomicBool`)
//!
//! ```
//! use crossfire::waitgroup::WaitGroup;
//! use std::thread;
//! use std::time::Duration;
//! use std::sync::atomic::{AtomicBool, Ordering};
//!
//! const MAX_CONCURRENT_TASKS: usize = 4;
//! const TOTAL_TASKS: usize = 10;
//!
//! // Initialize WaitGroup with a threshold of N-1.
//! // `wait()` will block when the number of running tasks is >= N.
//! // The `AtomicBool` is used to track if any task failed.
//! let mut wg = WaitGroup::<AtomicBool>::new(AtomicBool::new(true), MAX_CONCURRENT_TASKS - 1);
//!
//! // Use a simple for loop to spawn a total of 10 tasks.
//! for i in 0..TOTAL_TASKS {
//!     // `wait()` blocks until `wg.get_left() < MAX_CONCURRENT_TASKS`.
//!     // This effectively waits for a slot to become available.
//!     wg.wait();
//!     // A slot is available, spawn a new task.
//!     let guard = wg.add_guard();
//!     thread::spawn(move || {
//!         thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(100));
//!         // do some work
//!         if i == 5 {
//!             // Notify failure
//!             guard.store(false, Ordering::SeqCst);
//!         }
//!         drop(guard);
//!     });
//! }
//! // After spawning all tasks, wait for the remaining running tasks to finish.
//! // Set threshold to 0 to wait until all guards are dropped.
//! wg.set_threshold(0);
//! wg.wait();
//!
//! assert_eq!(wg.get_left_seqcst(), 0);
//! assert_eq!(wg.load(Ordering::SeqCst), false);
//! ```
//!
//! **Async Example**
//!
//! This example demonstrate task and sub-task, dynamic increase ref count by cloning WaitGroupGuard.
//!
//! ```
//! use crossfire::waitgroup::WaitGroup;
//! use std::time::Duration;
//!
//! #[tokio::test]
//! async fn wait_group_async_example() {
//!     let wg = WaitGroup::new((), 0);
//!     for _j in 0..4 {
//!         // Create a guard for the manager task.
//!         let parent_guard = wg.add_guard();
//!         tokio::spawn(async move {
//!             // This manager task will spawn 2 workers.
//!             for i in 0..2 {
//!                 let child_guard = parent_guard.clone();
//!                 tokio::spawn(async move {
//!                     // Do some work...
//!                     tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_millis(50 * (i + 1))).await;
//!                     // worker_guard is dropped here.
//!                 });
//!             }
//!             // The manager's work is to spawn workers,
//!             // so it drops its own guard after the loop.
//!             drop(manager_guard);
//!         });
//!     }
//!     // Wait until the manager guard and all its clones are dropped.
//!     wg.wait_async().await;
//!     assert_eq!(wg.get_left_seqcst(), 0);
//! }
