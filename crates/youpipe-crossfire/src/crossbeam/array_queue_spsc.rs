//! Modify by frostyplanet@gmail.com for the crossfire crate:
//!
//!   - Modify for SPSC, remove the `stamp` field
//!   - Optimization: pack head/tail and their cached counterparts into single AtomicU64 (u32 each).
//!   - Add token interface according to crossbeam-channel
//!   - Modified push() to push_with_ptr();
//!   - Add try_push_oneshot() which combinds the logic of push and check_full in one step;
//!   - Remove unused functions.
//!
//! Fork from crossbeam-queue crate commit 5a154def002304814d50f3c7658bd30eb46b2fad
