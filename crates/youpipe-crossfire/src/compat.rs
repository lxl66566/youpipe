//! compatible layer for V2.0 API
//!
//! # Migration from v2.* to v3
//!
//! If you want to migrate to v3 API, you may add the flavor type in [MTx], [MRx], [Tx], [Rx] type,
//! and change the channel initialization function accordingly.
//!
//! If you have a large project that use v2 API, and want to migrate gradually,
//! only need to change original import from  `use crossfire::*` to `use crossfire::compat::*`.
//! This module provides the [CompatFlavor] which erase the difference between `List` and `Array`,
//! but registry only use RegistryMulti for spsc and mpsc for compatibility.
//!
//! # Compatible consideration
//!
//! - In the legacy API, the sender/receiver types had erased the signature between bounded or unbounded channels
//! - The low level queue implement is for MPMC regardless of MPSC/SPSC model (which is exactly the
//!   same with V2.1)
//! - The module structure in `crossfire::compat::*`, is exactly the same as v2.x `crossfire::*`.
//!
//! # Incompatible notes
//!
//! - keeping Into<AsyncStream<T, F>> for `AsyncRxTrait<T>` is not possible, due to `AsyncRxTrait<T>`
//!   is erased out Flavor parameter, so we remove this method.
//!
//! # The reason of complete API refactor
//!
//! I know we all hate the contagious nature of generic code, and reluctant to use trait object,
//! it's common practice to use static dispatch like `enum-dispatch`. Originally crossfire only
//! have 2 channel variance ([CompatFlavor]), when adding more channel flavor for specific scenario,
//! other than common list and array, and specialized implement for spsc, mpsc, etc,
//! I notice that when the flavor enum grow from 2 types to 4+ types,
//! although the positive result can be observed on Arm, there was a regression in x86 async benchmark,
//! which offset the optimization effort.
//! It's impossible to erased the type while keeping the performance goal having so much types.
//!
//! From the aspect of compiler:
//! - In blocking context, the compiler can eliminate the unused branch according to the context,
//!   and keeping the function calls inline, unless you put multiple variant of enum together into a
//!   collection.
//! - In async context, the compiler is ignorance, since most of the async code is indirect calls.
//!   We can see in generated asm from cargo-show-asm, even you initialize the channel with ArrayQueue, there's still
//!   SeqQueue match branch inside the `RecvFuture::poll()`. What's worse when we have 4 types
//!   variant in the flavor enum, the compiler think the internal queue ops function no longer worth
//!   to inline (because overall flatten code will be too big), and the match branch might fallen
//!   back to a big match table instead of simple comparison. This is the reason of performance regression.
//!
//! From the aspect of CPU:
//! - I had tried a manual Vtable by putting method ptr inside AsyncTx/AsyncRx, which is ok on X86,
//!   but Arm will have -50% penalty. It looks like Arm is poor on loading / caching function ptr.
//! - Generic Arm CPU has overall poor performance (1/3 ~ 1/2) compared to mainstream x86_64, and
//!   bad at atomic CAS, a big match branch might be not so obvious than the positive effect from
//!   changing some CAS to direct load/store in the lockless algorithm.
//!
//! From the aspect of API usage:
//! - There're already nice native select mechanisms on async ecology, we don't have to worry about the
//!   difference of receiver types, for flexibility.
//! - For blocking context, it might be more common scenario to select from the same type of channels for efficiency.
//! - The crossbeam implementation of select is decouple from channel types and message type, which
//!   means the API is possible for crossfire too.
